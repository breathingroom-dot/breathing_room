###Why Breathing Room?

I am a young adult navigating the US in the 2020s decade. I am a theology blogger at Patheos Progressive Christian, and I wanted to make my own website to expand what topics I write about and create a cute, sweet little space for me to write without censorship. I hope to write about global conflicts, domestic politics, and of course I hope to continue my regular content about my relationship to faith. If things get worse on social media, I hope to move all my writing here. My writing needs, simply put, breathing room!
